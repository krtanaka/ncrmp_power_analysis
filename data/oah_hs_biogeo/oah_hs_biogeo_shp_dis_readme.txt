#oah_hs_biogeo_shp_dis shapefile was created by ESD largely following the boundaries of the M_Struct, D_Struct and Zone classifications (columns) in the benthic habitat maps generated by the biogeography branc of NCCOS (original data source: X:\GIS\Data\MainHI\AllIslands\BenthicHabitatLayers\2007\WGS84_UTM\oahu_utm4n.shp). HardSoft classes were reclassed into the following:
General rules are:
M_STRUCT = Coral Reef and Hardbottom: Hard
M_STRUCT = Unconslidated Sediment: Soft
M_STRUCT = Other Delineations and ZONE = Land: Land
M_STRUCT = Other Delineations and ZONE <> Land: Other
M_STRUCT = Unknown: Unknown

Based on the visual inspection against the ArcGIS online imagery, some manual modifications were made and hardSoft classes were reclassed into the following:
